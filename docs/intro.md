I'm Arjit Praveen, an undergrad CS student, cybersecurity enthusiast and an aspiring `red teamer`. I've dedicated this entire blog to documenting my learning progress and to share it to those it might help. 

### How to navigate this blog

I've divided content throughout this blog into several pages. The one that you're in is the `reads` page - this is where I showcase a lot of my featured content, it includes my [cybersecurity notes](), [featured CTF write-ups](), [activities and projects]() and [case studies]().
