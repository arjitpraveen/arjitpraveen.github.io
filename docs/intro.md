I'm Arjit Praveen, an undergrad CS student and a cybersecurity enthusiast. I've dedicated this entire blog to documenting my learning progress and to share it to those it might help. I've sectioned the site into:

1. [Notes](/docs/category/cybersecurity-notes): General notes on cybersecurity topics.
2. [Featured CTF write-ups](/docs/category/featured-ctf-write-ups): Noteable write-ups of my favourite CTF competitions
3. [Case studies](/docs/category/case-studies): My case studies on infamous cybercrimes, among many other things I'll be writing about.
4. [Projects/Activities](): Featured projects. You can find all of them on my [github]().
5. [Misc](): Miscellaneous stuff. Mostly non-cybersecurity notes of whatever I find interesting.
6. ["Extended" Blog](): More stuff which needed it's own section.
