## What are CTFs?

CTFs (Capture The Flag) are cybersecurity competitions that involve challenges focused on information security. They provide a fun and practical way for both beginners and experts to develop, test, and prove their skills. There are several categories these challenges fall under, here are a few:

  A[CTF Categories] --> B[Cryptography]
  A --> C[Forensics]
  A --> D[Web Exploitation]
  A --> E[Reverse Engineering]
  A --> F[Binary Exploitation]
  A --> G[Misc / OSINT]
```

The purpose of this blog is to provide beginners with fundamental knowledge in CTFs and introduce them to the tools they can use to solve these challenges. 

A little side note, while **steganography** fallse under Forensics, we will have a separate section for it. You can find it on the [sidebar](/ctf-guide/Steganography/intro.md)! I will also link several external resources throughout the articles if you'd like to further study the concepts mentioned.
