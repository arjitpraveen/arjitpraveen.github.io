## What is Steganography?

Steganography is the art of hiding information withing a non-secret message, image, video or sound file. By doing so, it makes it look more inconspicuous as compared to cryptography techniques with are easily noticable, though harder to extract the information.

There is a wide range of file types and methods of hiding files/data. And in the subsequent pages we're going to go over multiple tools that we use to extract these information.

You can find all the files used on the github repo.
